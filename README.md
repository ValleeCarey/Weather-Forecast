# Weather-Forecast

This javascript project I implemented a method to describe the current forecast to fahrenheit. 

I converted the temperature from Kelvin to Fahrenheit by subtracting from the variable celsius and using the mathematical equation to calculate the fahrenheit.

I use Math.floor() to round the decimal to the nearest interger

Also, I calculated the temperature in Newton by implementing the same formula to calvulate the Fahrenheit except using celsius * (33/100) to extract the Newton temperature. 

This method will work with any nuumber by using the 'let' keyword i was able to reassign the variable.
